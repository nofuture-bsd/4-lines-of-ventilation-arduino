Due to the onset of summer, which is the year, there is a need to control the temperature in the room for mining. For several years, I used semi-automatic ready-made solutions for these needs used for floor heating in a private house and 4 ventilation lines instead of heaters. For 4 channels 4 such devices were used with a maximum switching power of 30 kW, but every year the level of laziness increases in proportion to the level of experience and suddenly the idea arose to use the Arduino for these purposes. Cheap and angry) I initially purchased the Arduino UNO R3 and 4-channel relay board. This is my first meeting with microcontrollers and this acquaintance was wonderful)))) on the second meeting with the Arduino, I brought LCD Shield 1602 for better understanding and assembled a unit on electromagnetic starters. And I got to the point! We found a common language, but something tells me that my curve code is not even an approximate standard of communication with the Arduino IDE, although it works. And in the plans to screw in this project instead of relays and electromagnetic starters - triacs controlled by PWM ...
